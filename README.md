# esx_pamroulette

Took down my forked version due to me unknowingly using stolen code, here's the original authors roulette script instead

I have since discussed with the original author and he approved me to upload his updated version instead rather. We have worked things out since and there's no bad blood between us

This version features:

-Betting for color

-Betting for numbers

-Synced DrawText for roulette numbers between players
