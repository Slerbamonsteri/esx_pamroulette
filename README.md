I Took down my forked version, due to me unknowingly using stolen code, here's the original authors roulette script instead

I have since discussed with the original author (Discord: Pamppa#8074 ), and he gave me permission to upload his updated version instead. We have worked things out since and there's no bad blood between us

Check out his Tebex: https://pamppa.tebex.io

This version features:

-Betting for color

-Betting for numbers

-Synced DrawText for roulette numbers between players

And some other cool functions
